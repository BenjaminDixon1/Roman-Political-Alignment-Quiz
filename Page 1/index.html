 <h1>The Roman Political Alignment Quiz</h1>
 <p>
 In the <span class="underline-hover-effect"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Roman_Republic">late Roman Republic</a></span>
  politics was divided between <span class="underline-hover-effect"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimates_and_populares">conservatives and reformers</a></span>, with a few moderates nestled uncomfortably in between.
 This political divide also began to manifest itself increasingly through violence, culminating famously in 
 
 <span class="underline-hover-effect"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Caesar</a></span>'s murder.
 Politically motivated assasinations then gave way to civil war, as they had a generation before, ending in the consolidation of power around Caesar's adopted son, 
 
 <span class="underline-hover-effect"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Octavian</a></span>. 
 Had you been a member of the Senate during those fateful years, you might have changed the course of history. Take this quiz to see in which direction.

 <ul>
  <li class="underline-hover-effect"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimates_and_populares"><h3>Conservatives</h3></a></li>
    <p>The traditional view of the optimates refers to aristocrats who defended their own material and political interests and behaved akin to modern fiscal 
      conservatives in opposing wealth redistribution and supporting small government.
      To that end, the optimates were viewed traditionally as emphasising the authority or influence of the senate over other organs of the states, 
      including the popular assemblies.</p>
  <li class="underline-hover-effect"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimates_and_populares"><h3>Moderates</h3></a></li>
    <p>Moderates are those bands of uncomfortable senators trying to maintain peace between two occasionally violent factions. The most significant moderate of the late Roman Republic was <span class="underline-hover-effect"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero">Cicero</a></span>.</p>
  <li class="underline-hover-effect"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimates_and_populares"><h3>Reformers</h3></a></li>
    <p>The populares tended to operate before the popular assemblies, generally in opposition to the senate,
       using the populace, rather than the senate, as their choice of political weapon. The specific mechanics of this may include intimidating the senate through
      implicit or explicit threats of mob violence, or bypassing its authority entirely by focusing on the people's assembly.</p>
